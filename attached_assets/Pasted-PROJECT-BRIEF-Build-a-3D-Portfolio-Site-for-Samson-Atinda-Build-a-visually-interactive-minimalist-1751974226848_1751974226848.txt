PROJECT BRIEF: Build a 3D Portfolio Site for Samson Atinda

Build a visually interactive, minimalist 3D portfolio website for Samson Atinda, a multidisciplinary African creative ‚Äî developer, designer, and educator.

üåê Inspiration:
Overall layout and interaction inspired by https://p5aholic.me/projects

Additional style inspiration from design references shared (Google Drive):

üéØ Goals:
Showcase personality, portfolio, and multi-disciplinary projects

Serve as a professional reference (like a resume/CV)

Inspire others with creative and technical expression

üõ† Tech Stack:
React.js (frontend)

TailwindCSS (styling)

Three.js + React Three Fiber (3D canvas)

GLSL shaders via raw WebGL or Three.js custom shaders

GSAP for scroll-based and entrance animations

Tweakpane for live parameter tweaking (developer mode)

Framer Motion for transitions (optional)

JSON to store and dynamically load project data

üìê Structure:
1. Landing Page

Name: Samson Atinda

Tagline: ‚ÄúI build. I speak. I design.‚Äù

Background: WebGL shader animation (GLSL fragment shader inspired by The Book of Shaders ‚Äî e.g., flow fields, generative lines, or particles)

Intro animation using GSAP

2. Project Gallery (Main View)

Styled like p5aholic: grid of projects (each animated on hover)

Each tile:

Name, short description

On click ‚Üí opens external link in new tab (Fortune Kustoms, Spotify, etc.)

Tiles dynamically loaded from a projects.json file

3. About Me Page

A bio section with scroll animation

Timeline or visual narrative (use GSAP / Framer Motion)

Quote: ‚ÄúI build to inspire. I design to express. I speak to empower.‚Äù

4. Contact Page

Clean section with form + social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Spotify)

5. Resume Download

Button that links to a hosted PDF (can use Notion or Dropbox for now)

üîß Additional Dev Requirements:
Mobile responsive

Modular file structure

Use React Three Fiber canvas as background with custom GLSL shader for generative background

Allow easy toggling of visual settings via Tweakpane (for dev)

Transitions between sections powered by GSAP

Prepare for easy deployment via Netlify or Vercel
